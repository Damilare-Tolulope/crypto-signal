2. Install dependencies: Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project (`./talentplus-vetting-task`) directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash

```

3. Start the development server: After the dependencies have been installed, run the following command to start the development server:
